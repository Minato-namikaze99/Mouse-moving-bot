# Mouse-moving-bot
This is a Mouse Moving Bot that I made using Python and the PyAutoGUI library.

> P.S. I would recommend running this program in a Virtual Environment to avoid the issue of collision between various modules. You can take a look at [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-virtual-environment/) article to manage Virtual Environments. 


To run this, you only need to install 1 additional module, which can be installed using the following command:

`
pip install pyautogui
`


Now, run the program!

> Note that since there is an infinite loop running, you need to close the program manually.
